This is a full installation of Servoy Developer
You can now start the developer by going into the "developer" directory and start "servoy" executable
First time you will be asked to install a postgresql database with or without sample
The sample data is  used by the solutions that are shipped as samples (that can be imported).
So if you are evaluating the product please install the database with sample data.
